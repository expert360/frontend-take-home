# Expert360 Frontend Coding Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Your objective is to create a card component along the lines of what we use in our app. See the screenshot below:

The component doesn't need to be a pixel perfect match, but should demonstrate your knowledge about best practices in React, CSS and Javascript generally. We've included some tests you can use to ensure the component functions correctly and is reusable, please ensure these are updated and passing.

Feel free to leave comments and documentation - the more we understand your process, the better. :)


## Useful Commands

In the project directory, you can run the following (either using npm or yarn, depending on which package manager you've set up locally):

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
